## Overview

## Software Installation


You will need to bring an internet-enabled laptop to the course and install the latest versions of *both* R ***and*** RStudio before coming to the course

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

### Windows

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from CRAN. Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop). Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

### Linux

You can download the binary files for your distribution from CRAN. Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo yum install R`). Also, please install free [the RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
